## Search For Artists (Artist focus)

* tmfy search -ar Jay-z 
    - Focus to specific ar
* tmfy search albums
    - drops(prints on CLI) Focus Albums (#number - name of album (year), limit 10)
    - Formats will be
        #number Album-Title, Artist-Name, Date of release
    - Examples
        #1 4:44, Jay-Z July7-2017
        #2 The Black Album, Jay-Z, Nov14, 2003
        #3 The Blueprint (Explicit), Jay-Z, Sep11, 2001
once we searched an album, we could do two things
1. Play the album
* tmfy play #1 (no shuff)
* tmfy play #1 -sf (with shuffel) 
    -> this plays album number 1 with or without shuffel, we can play any number 

2. Search the album it self
* tmfy -tr #1
    - drops(prints on CLI) tracks of #number albums (all in sequence) (selected)
    - Formats will be
        #number Track-Title, Artist name and Ft (if any), length
    - Examples
        #1 Kill Jay Z, Jay-Z, 2:54
        #2 The Story of O.J., Jay-Z, 3:50   
        #3 Smile, Jay-Z, Gloria Carter, 4:48
* tmfy play #1 (plays track 1)
* tmfy play #2 (plays track 2)

## Search For Albums (Album Focused)

* tmfy search -al 4:44
* tmfy search -al 4:44 Jay-Z
* tmfy search -al Jay-Z 4:44
(all should do the same thing)
    - Focuses to specific Album, same as when we search for albums after Artist focus
    - Should do exactly the same thing as tmfy search albums after artist focus


## Search for Tracks (Focus is not important here)

* tmfy search -tr Jay-Z
    - Drops (Prints on CLI) Relevant tracks exactly like the printing an album format (limit 10)
* tmfy play #1,2...

* tmfy search Jay-Z -tr Smile
    - Drops or prints the searched track (5 limits), with same format
* tmfy play #1,2....
